Howdy and welcome to the second edition of my coding blog!

Today I'm going to talk a little about my experience creating this program: 

 **The Mushroom Identification Command Line Interface**

This program scrapes mushroom foraging info from online and provides it to the user through a command line interface.

Here's a demo!

Here's a nice pic of some mushrooms:

When I first envisioned this project, I wanted to create something that would collect information about various local plants, such as trees and flowers. I'm working on my plant indentification abilities, so I figured this would be a good way to combine those interests with my coding journey.

I'm currently located in Harrisburg, PA. It was pretty tough to find a scrape-able site that contained information about Central PA plants specifically. I did find one with 10 common trees, but the information was so rudimentary that I quickly grew frustrated. I decided to refactor to another topic.

I came across [The Foraging Guide](http://www.foragingguide.com),  and after a few minutes inspecting it with Chrome's developer tools, knew this would be a great topic for my Scraper CLI project.

I think I've got a respectably clean and useful program on my hands here. Potential features to add would be to search for mushrooms by name, to browse through specific features of the mushrooms (such as viewing ones that have similar caps or stems). Take it for a spin and see what you think!
