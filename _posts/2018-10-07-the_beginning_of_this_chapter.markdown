Welcome! Welcome to this space, which is soon to be filled with letters. I'll be writing about my current journey. A journey... of DISCOVERY.

> Look at these guys. On a journey of discovery. Marvelous.

I've never written a dedicated blog before, EXCITING!

I suppose I should write a little about why it is that I am putting this out here. What is this about? It's a plunge into learning software development. A few years ago, I graduated from university after majoring in cognitive science and spending lots of time making music around the Northeast US. At that time, though I enjoyed both, I was feeling more inspired by the work I'd done in music than the work I'd done in brain science. I decided to run with that. Since then, I have been pursuing music performance, recording, writing, networking, etc. Seeking out as many opportunities as I could get involved in. It's been wonderful honestly. As for the work I've been doing alongside my musicianship, that could use a change. ENTER SOFTWARE.

> Seeing the Matrix way back when was probably the first time I thought: "woah. coding. how cool!"

Back in school, because of the convergence and overlap of cognitive and computer science, I learned some C++, some Python, and a bit about data structures and user experience design. It was something I really enjoyed. Despite this, I did not seriously pursue the possibility of continuing work in this area after graduating. 

Perhaps I was concerned about the mental battle between being dedicated to music endeavors and being dedicated to an interesting, inspiring tech job. Perhaps I thought that working at a less demanding day job would leave more mental energy for creative work. Whatever my real motivations may have been, I've changed my perspective on this. I now think it would be healthier, more productive and ultimately more enjoyable to balance multiple projects that stir my passions and that demand my utmost intellectual capacity.

So! The music-obsessed pieces of my self will have to learn to share while I gear up my abilities in this new arena, and as I put in dedicated work towards absorbing a vast amount of information.

> Listen, you don't have to do this. I still love you. I promise I'll still play you everyday. Just put the computer down and hand me the glass of water. That's it. That's a nice guitar.

I *very* much am enjoying my plunge so far. I'm drawn to coding for so many reasons. I've always been emotionally invested in technological developments, gadgets, sci-fi, futurism. That stuff gets me going. I get excited when I remember how wonderful it is that I carry the library of the world in my pocket, that I can listen to millions of musicians, look at stunning art, ANY TIME. That I can find remote, obscure, amazing locations because some stranger was kind enough to publish instructions directing me there, and my little knowledge-device will even give me driving directions in its slightly creepy robot voice. And soon the robot/chaffeur/car might drive me there itself!?

> Holy cow, man.

Enough nerding out, you already know what I'm saying. And we also both know that the only way that all this flows is through the hard work of engineers. The idea that I will participate in creating this once unimaginable reality is extremely motivating. As someone who has been dedicated to music for a while, I am especially fascinated by the way music and software have become intertwined: specifically in terms of music consumption, streaming services, algorithmic music discovery, artists' connections with fans, etc. I look forward to exploring further in this area and potentially becoming directly involved. Though, at this point, I'm certainly not one to strictly contain myself to a small area of interest. WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT.

In this space expect to see more posts about the work I'm doing, as well as some more corny jokes that I'll surely throw in. Hey! Thanks for reading this.
