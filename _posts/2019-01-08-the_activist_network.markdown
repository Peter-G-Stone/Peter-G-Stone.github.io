## A social network but with fewer cat memes, ads and nefarious political operators.

I set out to create a project that was essentially similar to some of the other major social networks out there, but which would be specifically aimed towards what I see as one of the main boons of the social network culture we have developed. By this I mean the way that twitter, whats app, facebook etc can be used to connect disparate individuals over meaningful causes.

.

One of the main issues I find with using the existing social networks is that many of my friends and the people I follow are consistently posting what I would consider relatively inessential information. Complaints about relationships. Silly comics. Sports commentary. On top of that are the relentless and eerily accurate targeted ads.

.

Now - there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a social forum for discussion of whatever. But it makes me personally want to stay away from these platforms because it does not feel like the way I would like to spend my fairly limited free time. I believe that there are many people who feel similarly, which opens up space for an app such as the one I designed.

.

This app is designed using Ruby on Rails as part of the Flatiron curriculum's final Rails project assignment. In its current state, users can register, join and create groups, make posts in those groups, and make comments on posts. You can search through groups or users. You can see which groups have been Recently Active ( active in the last hour ). You can go to a user's profile page and see their groups, where they've recently posted, where they've recently commented.

.

Ideally the final version would include the ability to create events, the ability for users to have a calendar of events, a private messaging option, ability to collect groups via related causes, etc.
